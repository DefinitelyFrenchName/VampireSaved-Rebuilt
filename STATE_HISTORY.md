# STATE_HISTORY — the archive of STATE.md's session groups

**Opened 2026-10-18 (session R-002), `CLAUDE.md` [VSR-28].** Every session group that leaves `STATE.md` moves here
VERBATIM, newest first, never edited after the move; the index below is the lookup by session key ([VSR-30]).

## Session R-001 — **CLAUDE.md v1.0 validated, SPEC v0.2 accepted; the read-only guard installed; phase 0 started.** Opened 2026-10-18 on Opus 5.5 (the ruled orchestrator); transcript `dde4a561`.

### opened with

*"CLAUDE.md has been validated, the spec.md draft is accepted"*; then the maintainer's answers on the draft's loose
ends, the four read-only sources, *"Please add the hook and after that start phase 0"*.

### (1) THE LAW AND THE SPEC ACCEPTED; THE FOLLOW-UPS

`791d5bb`: both status lines. `c185504`: the filiation of [VSR-1]..[VSR-50] moved out of `CLAUDE.md` into
`docs/carried/ledger_claude_md.tsv`; vhunt2 dropped entirely ([VSR-38] narrowed to vsavj/vsav2, §7's VH2 clause
removed); `../ROMS` named in [VSR-8] with the read-only rule; typos. `9adf1a1`: the four read-only sources of truth
named in `CLAUDE.md` §7. Every ruling is verbatim in `SPEC.md` §0.

### (2) THE READ-ONLY GUARD

`ac61157`: `.claude/hooks/guard_readonly.py`, a PreToolUse hook refusing a write outside the working tree or to the
edit-locked hook files ([VSR-49]); record and gaps in `docs/project/hooks.md`; gate `tests/test_readonly_guard.py`
(59 cases, both controls FIRED, both control modes FAIL). Live: a no-op `rm -f` outside the tree was refused. Two gaps
found the same hour (Decisions pending, item 1).

### (3) PHASE 0 STARTED: WHERE, FROM WHICH COMMIT, AND THE BASELINE

The spec put phase 0 in the original, which the ruling of (1) made read-only; asked, the maintainer ruled it runs
here, reading the original at `bf92acd2` (`SPEC.md` §0, §3 amended). `tools/export_original.py` exports a pinned
commit through `git ls-tree`/`git cat-file` only, into a directory that must not exist. The baseline, measured by a
measurer worker ([VSR-47]) on its own export:

| figure | value |
|---|---|
| export of `bf92acd2` | tree `0a40f749ea3a`, 17,068 files (542,160,969 bytes); 3 submodules skipped (emu/fbneo, emu/jtcores, emu/mame) |
| the original's checkout, status entries before / after | 936 / 936 |
| census manifests | 30 |
| gameplay: in-table / derived / baked / total | 15 / 0 / 221 / 236 |
| fact: in-table / derived / baked / total | 0 / 541 / 7,979 / 8,520 |
| code: in-table / derived / baked / total | 0 / 0 / 30 / 30 |

These equal `SPEC.md` §1's figures at `6dee2be7`. What the census counts: every scalar of the 30 canonical manifests
and every module-level constant of six generators, by (kind, key); the gameplay column is variant selection
(`only_variant_slot`, `only_base_slot`, `unless_composed`, `id_by_profile`, `dst_slot`, `mirror_variant`,
`roster_subst`, the select wheel's `layout`, adjacency and `edges_in`, `tenant.id`, and three `aux_poke.val` judged by
address), held in `donovan.toml`, `huitzil.toml`, `pyron.toml`, `shared_writes.toml` and `effect_tail.json`.

**Not done in this sitting:** no rule-checker ran before any action ([VSR-48]): the rebuild has no rule-checker tool
yet (`docs/project/rule_checker.md` is its spec), so none of this sitting's commits had one.

### (4) THE TWO PENDING ITEMS RULED: THE GUARD'S FIX PREPARED, TICKETS OPENED

The maintainer: *"yes and yes"* (`SPEC.md` §0). The fix is `build/proposed/hooks/guard_readonly.py` (#2): where git
acts now includes `--git-dir`/`--work-tree` (both forms) and `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`; `-c` values are skipped;
`archive` is a read (its `-o` judged); `fetch` leaves the read list and `config`/`branch`/`remote` read only in their
reading forms. The gate gained `--hook <path>` and 14 cases. On the proposal: 73 cases (48 block, 25 allow), PASS, both
controls FIRED, both control modes FAIL. On the installed hook: FAIL on exactly the 10 cases #2 names. A replay of the
sitting's 59 calls through both hooks: 0 differences. Tickets: `docs/project/tickets.tsv` holds #1 (the umbrella
ticket carried from the original's #120, already open) and #2.

### (5) #2 INSTALLED AND CLOSED

The maintainer installed the proposal (`cp`, 2026-10-18); the installed hook is byte-identical to it (`cmp`). The gate
on the installed hook: 73 cases, `VERDICT: PASS`, both controls FIRED, both control modes `VERDICT: FAIL`. Live: `git -C
<original> archive bf92acd2 SPEC.md | tar -t` ran; `GIT_DIR=../ROMS/.git git reset --hard` was refused. The proposal
file was removed once installed (it is in this sitting's history).

### (6) PHASE 0: THE 236 GAMEPLAY VALUES TABLED

The format, decided as `SPEC.md` §4 asks, with its reasons in `docs/project/tables/README.md`: one TSV per subject,
one schema for all (`manifest, kind, row, key, value, line, prov_kind, prov_refs`), values as the manifest's literal,
provenance as the census's attribution (vocabulary word and references) with the paragraph left at its pinned line.
`tools/extract_gameplay_tables.py` imports the original's census from the export and aligns each record with its
row (`tools/phase0lib.py`): `variant_selection` 182, `select_wheel` 42, `roster` 9, `hit_class_mask` 3 = the
census's 236. Gate `tests/test_phase0_gameplay.py`: G1 regenerated equal, G2 the export's manifests are the pinned
SHA-1s, G3 the census column and the tables are the same multiset, G4 every cell equals an independent parse; three
controls (perturbed-value, dropped-row, perturbed-manifest). Exports now live under `build/` (git-ignored), inside
the tree. The figures in the README were reproduced by a measurer before the commit.

Paid for this sitting: the first control declarations predicted too few failing checks (a changed value also moves
G3's multiset); the declarations were corrected from the printed values, not the gate loosened. The JSON alignment
first compared the wrong tuple fields; fixed by one tuple layout for TOML and JSON.

### (7) PHASE 0: THE HEX RULING, AND THE 8,520 FACTS TABLED

Asked how the fact column's 649 hex fields (6,420 bytes, the largest 470) are carried, the maintainer chose "As
written, ruling into VSR-8" (`SPEC.md` §0): `CLAUDE.md` [VSR-8] now carries the #120 ruling's line, and each of the
7 runs over 64 bytes was checked before tabling. 2 are the project's own resolvers, carried. 5 hold whole vanilla or
vs2 routines or tables and are held out (`docs/project/tables/facts/held.tsv`, carried as `HELD:sha1=…`):
`index_window_018468`, `hitclass_map_extend` (Huitzil and Pyron), `beam_list_type6`, `throw_arc_tables`. Three of
them are produced by the original's generators.

The extractor and the gate were generalized and renamed: `tools/extract_tables.py` (was `extract_gameplay_tables.py`)
and `tests/test_phase0_tables.py` (was `test_phase0_gameplay.py`). Both columns: 8,756 rows in 56 tables (4 gameplay,
52 under `facts/`). JSON rows are JSON Pointers now (the `.` glyph of `version_font.json` broke dotted paths), which
changed `select_wheel.tsv`'s row column. Gate: G1–G4 as before over both columns, plus G5 (held values are only
their hashes, and none is in the clear); five controls, the two new ones `held-leak` and `perturbed-pointer-fact`.
The README's figures were reproduced by a measurer before the commit.

### (8) THE SESSION DASHBOARD, PROPOSED AND RULED (#3)

The maintainer asked for a dashboard of where time goes and the project's metrics. Proposed, then ruled: both
Claude's time and the maintainer's, split into Claude working, Claude waiting on tools, and the total; every figure
classed by how it was obtained, after the dashboard the maintainer named (the original's `tools/session_metrics.py`,
its #264: MEASURED, DERIVED, ESTIMATED, INFERRED, EXTRAPOLATED); a backfill "to the extent that you can"; built in
the next session, after this one closes. The plan and the maintainer's words are in #3. Measured this sitting: the
transcript carries per-turn wall time (`system/turn_duration`, on 11 turns only) and thinking time
(`thinkingDurationMs`, 141 messages), but no tool duration (to be DERIVED from timestamps); `0de1913b` is a 3-record
stub, and the drafting before R-001 ran in the original's 14z-205 (`995e7259`).

### CLOSE (R-001, 2026-10-18)

Delivered, all pushed: `CLAUDE.md` v1.0 and `SPEC.md` v0.2 accepted, with the follow-ups the maintainer ruled; the
read-only guard and its edit lock (#2 found, fixed and closed the same sitting); the ticket list (#1 carried, #2, #3);
`STATE.md`; phase 0's two value columns, 8,756 values in 56 tables with five held out. Gates at the close, on the
committed tree: `tests/test_readonly_guard.py` and `tests/test_phase0_tables.py` (verdicts in the close commit's
message). Not done: no rule-checker ran before any action ([VSR-48]; the tool does not exist yet). Left outside git:
the export `build/export_bf92acd2` (542 MB, git-ignored, kept for the gate; `tools/export_original.py` remakes it)
and this sitting's scratchpad exports. No background process is left running.
